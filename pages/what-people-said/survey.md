### And, what did you LEAST enjoy?

The wifi and venue were cited as the top items that respondents least enjoyed. As well there were some comments about the programme organization or content concerns.

{% include quote.html cite="" link="" quote="What I enjoyed the least was the location. It was the most amazing locations to look at, but the worst for these workshops. Too loud, the cardboard boxes were a visual aid to seperate the rooms, but not acoustically. Workshop spaces were not air conditioned, which in some cases became dangerously hot and uncomfortable. I'm glad nobody fainted. Also some of the rooms had soundsystems that were not used. Too bad because some of the people, especially those who are not natively English didn't catch all the information. Look for a space with more smaller rooms in stead of bigger ones in the next years. Keynote room, fair and outdoor foodcourt were amazing though." %}

{% include quote.html cite="" link="" quote="Crowded, noisy and hot session spaces, which made it sometimes difficult to participate in the sessions" %}

### What was the most valuable thing you learned at the Festival? e.g. that you might pass on to someone else.

{% include quote.html cite="" link="" quote="That starting with open data is the wrong way to go. Start with problems that people face and then see whether/how open data can help." %}

{% include quote.html cite="" link="" quote="Need to channel the great skills and enthusiasm of the movement into a strategic policy agenda." %}

{% include quote.html cite="" link="" quote="That participants in the Open Movement have made their minds up about a lot of topic positions and that people new to the movement won't neccessarily (sic) find it easy to find out why these conclusions have been reached or reopen these discussions. That there is still a huge amount of work to be done making the open movement mainstream and accessible." %}
